# Brainstorm with Pdfs

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_color.svg)](https://pdfquestion-euvx4eayptjuxzvrht6wn5.streamlit.app/)

This application allows you to ask questions about the content of a PDF document and receive answers generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). It leverages semantic similarity to find relevant sections within the PDF before feeding them to the LLM, resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses.

## How it Works

The application follows these steps:

1.  **PDF Reading:** The application takes a PDF file as input and extracts its textual content.
2.  **Text Chunking:** The extracted text is split into smaller, manageable chunks. This is crucial for efficient processing by the LLM and for focusing on relevant information.
3.  **Embedding Generation:** Using Hugging Face Sentence Transformers, each text chunk is converted into a vector embedding. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
4.  **Question Embedding:** When you ask a question, it is also converted into a vector embedding using the same Sentence Transformer model.
5.  **Semantic Similarity Search:** The application calculates the semantic similarity between the question's embedding and the embeddings of all the text chunks. This identifies the chunks that are most relevant to your question.
6.  **Contextual Information for LLM:** The most semantically similar text chunks are retrieved and provided as context to the LLM.
7.  **Answer Generation:** The LLM uses the provided context to generate an answer to your question.
8.  **User Interface:** Streamlit provides an interactive graphical user interface for uploading PDFs and asking questions.
9.  **LLM Integration:** Langchain is used to seamlessly integrate with the LLM.

## Deployed Application

You can try the deployed application here: [https://pdfquestion-euvx4eayptjuxzvrht6wn5.streamlit.app/](https://pdfquestion-euvx4eayptjuxzvrht6wn5.streamlit.app/)

## Repository

The source code for this application can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/Samtoosoon/Pdfquestion/tree/main](https://github.com/Samtoosoon/Pdfquestion/tree/main)

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Samtoosoon/Pdfquestion.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Samtoosoon/Pdfquestion.git)
    cd Pdfquestion
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the repository.
    * Add your Hugging Face API key to the `.env` file. You can obtain an API key from the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

        ```
        HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
        ```
        *(Replace `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` with your actual API key)*

## Usage

1.  **Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.**

2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  **Open your web browser to the address displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).**

4.  **Follow the on-screen instructions:**
    * Upload a PDF file using the file uploader.
    * Enter your question in the text input field.
    * Click the "Ask" button to get your answer.

## Code Structure (Brief Overview)

* `app.py`: This is the main Streamlit application file that handles the user interface, PDF processing, embedding generation, similarity search, and interaction with the LLM.
* `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python dependencies required to run the application.
* `.env`: This file stores sensitive information like your Hugging Face API key. **Ensure this file is not committed to your version control system (e.g., add it to your `.gitignore` file).**
